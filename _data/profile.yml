  <p>
    A passionate computer science student with a robust foundation in algorithms and
    problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey in Computer Science began with a transition from literature, driven by a spirit of challenge. 
    Facing initial setbacks, I decided to take a break and seek a new perspective during a working holiday in Australia. 
    It was there, quite unexpectedly, that I received personal mentorship from a senior engineer. 
    This invaluable opportunity became a turning point, solidifying my career conviction and fueling my current dedication 
    to continuous learning and growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently leading a capstone project on LLM watermarking, an area that aligns with my keen
    interest in <br>generative AI. I am a dedicated learner, eager to contribute to
    innovative projects.
