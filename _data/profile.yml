  <p>
  I am a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in CS principles and algorithms. I also enjoy algorithmic problem-solving, having solved over 400 problems on the competitive programming site, Baekjoon.
  </p>
  <p>
  My journey in Computer Science began with a transition from literature, driven by a spirit of challenge. I was deeply interested in linguistics and wanted to approach it from a more technical perspective. However, without basic knowledge in engineering, I faced setbacks, took gap years, and even decided to seek a new path by leaving for a working holiday in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was there, quite unexpectedly, that the landlord of the house I stayed in—a software engineer from a leading tech company—became a significant role model. Through her, I was able to regain my passion for the field. While staying in Sydney, I devoted hours every day to studying algorithms after working an eight-hour shift at a cafe, gradually building my foundation in Computer Science again.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now, I believe that my resilience and fearless approach foster creativity, leading me toward a broader and more interesting world. I am currently leading a capstone project on LLM watermarking, an area that aligns with my keen interest in generative AI. I genuinely hope to contribute to innovative projects.
